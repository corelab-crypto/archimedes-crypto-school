# arch-crypto-workshop

This repo will contain the source code for the website for the crypto workshop (WIP!!!)

## How to run

The source is in `index.html`.
Ideally, clone the project, open using VS Code, and use the live server VS Code extension so that you can see the changes live.

Tools like Prettier help to maintain a nice looking code.
